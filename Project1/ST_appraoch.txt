a) The approach I took in implementing this symbol table was to use a DLB. 

b) I took this approach for lack of better options, to be hoonest. I orignally tried to
 use an R-Way Trie, but quickly found out that this would not work when I ran out of 
 memory very quickly. I then tried to use a Ternary Search Tree. This was functional, 
 but I am not as fimiliar with TST as I am with DLB's (after completing part one of the 
 project). As such, I was having a hard time using the TST to return the 10 passwords 
 which share the longest prefix. After this failure, I decided that a DLB was the way to
  go. My PassDLB is slightly different from my DLBtrie in that I stoed a double for the 
  value, rather than just having a boolean for the end of a key.
